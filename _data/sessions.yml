  title: "Introduction to Serverless Computing"
  description: "Serverless development is a hot topic. Most of the people heard that serverless is great for creating scalable and high-quality apps. But,  how easy is it, really? Pretty easy, actually! In this talk I’ll introduce serverless computing using Google Cloud.  How to get started,  how to build more complex applications and how to integrate 3rd party applications?  The talk will include Firestore, Cloud functions, PubSub, BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Rest API’s and how to combine these with third party applications.  "

  title: "Easy Microservices in the cloud with Kubernetes and Istio"
  description: "Microservices are a powerful method to build a scalable and agile backend, but managing these services is a nightmare. Once developed, the process of building, deploying, service discovery, load balancing, routing, tracing, auth, graceful failures, rate limits, and more are cumbersome and involves many moving parts. This session will show you how the Kubernetes container management system and Istio service mesh can simplify many of the operational challenges of microservices, including an in-depth live demo showcasing how easy it is to create and develop microservices with JHipster and deploying them into Kubernetes cluster with Istio service mesh."

  title: "Learn how to test your AI solution for DevOps"
  description: "Testing an AI solution is no longer possible using only traditional techniques. So how are you going to make sure that your AI solution behaves as expected? Join us and learn how to test and validate the quality of your AI solution during the complete DevOps cycle. We walk through the DevOps for AI cycle to see which challenges we have on testing and validating an AI solution. How do you know you solve the right problem, which data do you need and how do you know it works correctly? During all stages in DevOps you have to ask these questions and we show you how to answer these questions."

  title: "From Small Sensors to Big Queries"
  description: "I put a raspberry with sensors in every room in my house. This data is logged and compared with other sets in Big Query. I’ll talk about how you can do serverless apps around bigquery for IoT tasks and how you can command a fleet or raspberries for logging. It’s easier than you might think. Fun too.

In particular I will discuss how the only servers in my entire chain are the sensors themselves."

  title: "Akka Cluster vs Kubernetes: Clustering Solutions Showdown"
  description: "An Akka and a Kubernetes expert walk into a bar and try to figure out which one to use for distributed services. Does K8S bring value to distributed applications using Akka? Does Akka Cluster have a place in the age of K8S? This talk explores integration patterns between the two. Friends or foes? We came together as experts in Akka and Kubernetes, and battled it out to see who’s favourite technology is better suited for building modern distributed applications. Is Kubernetes the end of Akka Cluster? Does Akka Cluster offer more to JVM-based applications than Kubernetes does? Or is there reason for friendly coexistence?

In this talk we explore different patterns of using Kubernetes together, or in place of Akka Cluster. We will show pros and cons of each approach to give the audience guidance in navigating the conflicting and overlapping aspects of the two technologies.

During our research we have built examples of these patterns to underpin and demonstrate our conclusions with working code. This code will be made available publicly on Github."

  title: "Machine learning for developers (or: non-data scientists)"
  description: "Machine learning requires a very different mind set from normal development work. In this talk we’ll go over the differences in mind set you need to get into machine learning and we’ll show a lot of hands on examples on how you can get started with machine learning yourself without having to get a PHD first."

  title: "Serverless mobile apps with Flutter"
  description: "Flutter is awesome to develop apps for different phones. In this talk Arno will introduce & explain Flutter using an actual example (the Qlouder Library app). The goal is to show how you can use it to create an app with third party database links.

  Curious how to create an awesome Flutter app that connects to FireStore? Get seated and let Arno talk you through the way of working with Flutter. Using the example of a self-made library app, he’ll introduce and explain Flutter. How to get your app retrieving information about the book, the availability and the order status, or what if you want to chase another person to read a bit faster? Just some examples of what will be shown."
